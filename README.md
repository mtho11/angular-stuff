Learn me an Angular (_real goodly_)
=============
_A collection of resources for learning Angular.js based javascript UIs._

*Javascript has won the UI war,* so lets get on with building ourselves some cool UIs with javascript. The are many javascript frameworks out there for creating UIs but Google's Angular framework makes creating UIs fun again and yet manages to add features such as unit and integration testing as a core part of the architecture via dependency injection.

### Angular.js Features:
* Two-Way Binding (automatic updating of model/view)
* Directives (declarative html tags with code behind them)
* Dependency Injection (great for testing)
* Page Routing (bookmarkable pages in a Single-Page-Application)
* Form Validation (declarative)
* Hierarchical Event Bus (send events up or down the dom)
